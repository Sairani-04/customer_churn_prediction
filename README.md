# Customer Churn Prediction 📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts **customer churn** for a subscription-based service using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**. The model helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave so they can take proactive actions to retain them.

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow/Keras** 🧠 (for ANN model)
- **Pandas & NumPy** 📊 (for data manipulation)
- **Scikit-Learn** 🏋️ (for preprocessing & evaluation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📊 (for data visualization)

## 📂 Project Structure
```
📁 customer-churn-prediction
│-- churn_prediction.py        # Main script to train & evaluate the model
│-- data/telco_customer_churn.csv  # Dataset
│-- README.md                  # Project documentation
│-- requirements.txt            # Python dependencies
```

## 🚀 How to Run
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Run the Model**
```bash
python churn_prediction.py
```

## 📊 Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** _XX%_  
- **ROC-AUC Score:** _XX%_  
- **Confusion Matrix:** Shows churn vs. non-churn classification.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Tune the ANN model for better performance.
- Try different architectures (e.g., CNN, LSTM for time-series churn data).
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit.
