# Customer Churn Prediction  

## Project Overview  
This project predicts customer churn for a subscription-based service using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The model helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave so they can take proactive actions to retain them.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- TensorFlow/Keras (for ANN model)  
- Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)  
- Scikit-Learn (for preprocessing & evaluation)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)  

## Project Structure  
```
customer-churn-prediction  
│-- churn_prediction.ipynb      # Jupyter Notebook with model training & evaluation  
│-- telco_customer_churn.csv   # Dataset  
│-- README.md                  # Project documentation  
│-- requirements.txt            # Python dependencies  
```

## How to Run  

1. Clone the Repository  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/customer-churn-prediction.git  
   cd customer-churn-prediction  
   ```
2. Install Dependencies  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook  
   ```
   jupyter notebook churn_prediction.ipynb  
   ```  

## Model Performance  
- Accuracy: 78%  
- Confusion Matrix: Shows churn vs. non-churn classification.  

## Next Steps  
- Tune the ANN model for better performance.  
- Try different architectures (e.g., CNN, LSTM for time-series churn data).
